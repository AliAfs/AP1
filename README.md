# AP1 - Analysis of Increment Statistics and PCA for Wind Power 
## (still ongoing...)

## Introduction:
It is anticipated that significantly more renewable energy sources would be deployed as a result of a rising demand for energy services and attention to environmental issues. Due to decades of scientific discovery and technological advancement, wind energy is already becoming a common source of electricity. According to WindEurope, 116 GW of new wind farms will be installed in Europe between 2022 and 2026 [1]. Moreover, Germany will have the largest wind market in Europe as a result of its strong expected onshore market's performance over the next five years (19.7 GW) and growing offshore installations (5.4 GW) [1].
The renewable sources, such as wind, are highly fluctuating across different time scale which could greatly influence the power generated from these sources [2].  In order to have a stable supply grid based on renewable energies and predict the generated power, we need a deep understanding of their intermittent behavior.

### outline
In this project, I am going to inverstigate wind tourbines data from different wind farms in United States. The data is
provided by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
<br>The project contains data visualization, data analysis, and prediction on wind velocity and output power time series.
<br><b>1- Data Visualization:</b> Time Series Plot, Heat Maps
<br><b>2- Data Analysis:</b> 
<br><b>a)</b> Histogram of wind velocity and power (for single tourbine and all tourbines)
<br><b>b)</b> Scatter Plots. Correlation Matrix. Implementing PCA and finding Emprical Orthogonal Function( eofs).
<br><b>3- Statistical Model/Forcast</b>
